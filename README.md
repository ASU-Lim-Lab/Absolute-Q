Fluorescence_analysis.py script notes:

File name formating should be consistant with the sample csv files.

eg. BT01_143_01_01_F.csv

Information separated by underscore include test number (BT01), probe locaiton (143), batch number (01), sample number (01) and specific probe (F) ID.

All formatted csv files should reside in the same directory before running script. 


codon_analysis.py script notes:

Printed output can be saved using shell command $ script.py > output.txt

Unhash df output for troubleshooting if counts are off.
